infra base quick start
======================

Local configuration
-------------------

### Requirements :

-   Docker
-   Bash
-   An AWS account
-   All the dependencies listed in the Docker image (that you can use
    directly)

### Docker environment :

You can create a container to ensure you have all the correct softwares
and dependencies to work with the project, just by typing :

    ./workstation/launch.sh

And congratulations ! you have your workstation ready for work.

Project setup
-------------

### Set your naming conventions :

To set the configuration for your account,

There is an example of configuration here :

    configs
    └── mygroup
        └── myenv
            ├── ssh
            │   └── README.md
            ├── ansible
            └── terraform
                ├── commons.tfvars
                ├── layer-01-networking.tfvars
                └── layer-02-nginx.tfvars

To adapt to your own account and set your own values,

just copy paste the folder “mygroup”, and change the names of the
folders :

-   mygroup : is a logical entity that represent your context (for
    instance : “mycompany”)
-   myenv : is the iteration of the infrastructure dedicated to a
    purpose (for instance : “dev”, “staging” or “prod”)

Ansible configuration:
----------------------

-   First,we install Nginx Role :

<!-- -->

    ansible-galaxy install mehdi_wsc.nginx -p ./ansible/roles/external/

-   Second,We specify ansible configuration for the environnement:

<!-- -->

    export ANSIBLE_CONFIG="$PWD/<mygroup>-<myenv>-ansible.cfg"

Build Infrastructure :
----------------------

-   Run bootstrap script:

<!-- -->

    python -m mypackage_wsc.infra_bootstrap --provider aws --account < mygroup >-< myenv >

Run Build-infra script:

    python -m mypackage_wsc.infra_builder_terraform --account < mygroup >-< myenv >

And Voilà, you have created an infrastructure in your aws account !

### Ansible Nginx deployment :

Now the final step is to install nginx:

    python -m mypackage_wsc.install_nginx --group < mygroup > --env < myenv >

At this point, you can access to your public instance with http and you
will view Nginx server page.

-   Hence , the final architecture is:
