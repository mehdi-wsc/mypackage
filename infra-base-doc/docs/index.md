introduction
============

wedeployer skelleton is structure of folders ,it has been made to
facilitate the building , deploiment and configuration of the
infrastructure.

Benefits
========

- wedeployer skelleton allows you to launch wedeployer python package.
- you can use Docker workstation.
- high structure which facilitates debugging problems.

wedeployer package
==================

- wedeployer github page:

[Github wedployer repo](https://github.com/mehdi-wsc/mypackage)

Terraform structure
===================

tree below describes the required organization to set files:

    ├── terraform
    │   ├── bootstrap
    │   │   └── <provider>/(tf files)
    │   ├── layers
    │   │   └── <provider>
    │   │       ├── 01-<name of first layer>/(tf files)
    │   │       └── 02-<name of second layer>/(tf files)

- bootstrap: is folder where to store bootstap scenario for example (create s3 bucket and dynamodb to store tfstate).
- layers: is folder where to store your stack terraform layers.
- After bootstrap and layers you should specify the provider.
- Name of layer should be : xx-\<name of layer\>(with xx from 00 to 99).

configuration structure
=======================

To set the configuration for your account,

There is an example of configuration here :

    configs
    └── mygroup
        └── myenv
            ├── ssh
            │   └── README.md
            ├── ansible
            │   ├── inventory
            │   └── ssh.cfg
            └── terraform
                ├── commons.tfvars
                └── layer-xx-<name of layer>.tfvars

To adapt to your own account and set your own values,

just copy paste the folder "mygroup", and change the names of the
folders :

- mygroup: is a logical entity that represent your context (for instance : "mycompany").
- myenv: is the iteration of the infrastructure dedicated to a purpose (for instance : "dev", "staging" or "prod").
- Terraform tfvars: the name of file should be layer-xx-\<name of layer\>.tfvars.
- Ansible configs: you set ssh.cfg and inventory.

ansible structure
=================

ansible structure is simple , in your root create ansible folder and set
your main.yml inside it, like below:

    ansible
      ├── main.yml
      └── roles
           └── external

and specify roles in roles subdirectory.

configuration and templates files
=================================

- I had jinja2 templates to generate ansible configuration files  (ssh.cfg ,inventory,ansible.cfg).
- you can already customize your templates files in :

<!-- -->

    ./templates

Docker workstation
==================

-   You can define workstation to work in :

<!-- -->

    workstation/
     ├── Dockerfile
     └── launch.sh

I already set Dockerfile and Script to launch it , however you can
customize it.

Exemple configuration:
======================

:

    ├── ansible
    │   └── roles
    │       └── external
    │           └── mehdi_wsc.nginx
    ├── configs
    │   └── mygroup
    │       └── myenv
    │           ├── ansible
    │           ├── ssh
    │           └── terraform
    ├── templates
    ├── terraform
    │   ├── bootstrap
    │   │   └── aws
    │   └── layers
    │        └── aws
    │           ├── 01-networking
    │           └── 02-nginx
    └── workstation
        ├── Dockerfile
        └── launch.sh

- to understand how it works , we have infra-base quickstart example:
